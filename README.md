# 🧠 AI Project: Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk

This project explores the development of an AI model to predict 30-day hospital readmission, with a structured approach to data, modeling, ethics, and deployment. It also includes a hypothetical task for predicting student dropout rates to demonstrate code automation and testing.
